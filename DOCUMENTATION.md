# Blog Project Implementation Documentation

## Project Overview
This blog project implements a full-stack application with user authentication, content management, and a custom Kancolle companion component. The backend uses FastAPI with SQLAlchemy for database operations, while the frontend is built with Vue.js and integrates with the backend via RESTful APIs.

## Database Schema
### User Model
- `id`: Primary key (auto-increment)
- `username`: Unique username
- `email`: Unique email
- `password_hash`: Hashed password
- `is_active`: Account status flag
- `created_at`: Account creation timestamp

### OAuthAccount Model
- `id`: Primary key
- `provider`: OAuth provider (GitHub, WeChat, QQ)
- `provider_id`: Unique ID from OAuth provider
- `user_id`: Foreign key to User
- `created_at`: Link creation timestamp

### Additional Models
- Message, Tool, About, and Links models were designed to support content pages, with appropriate fields for text content and metadata.

## API Endpoints
### Authentication
- GitHub/WeChat/QQ OAuth login endpoints
- Token generation and validation
- User registration and profile management

### Content Management
- Article CRUD operations
- Message/Comment submission
- Tool/About/Links content retrieval

### Kancolle Integration
- Dedicated endpoint for companion data (not required for MVP, as component is self-contained)

## Frontend Structure
### Pages
- HomePage: Displays latest articles and Kancolle companion
- BlogListPage/BlogDetailPage: Article browsing and reading
- MessagePage: Message submission form
- ToolsPage/AboutPage/LinksPage: Static content pages
- LoginPage: OAuth authentication flow

### Components
- Kancolle.vue: Interactive companion component with greeting and interaction
- Reusable UI components (cards, lists, buttons) for consistent styling

## OAuth SSO Implementation
- GitHub: Uses OAuth 2.0 with `user:email` scope
- WeChat/QQ: Implements OAuth 2.0 with openID-based user linking
- Token storage: JWT tokens stored in localStorage for session management

## Kancolle Component
- Vue 3 component with:
  - Character image and greeting text
  - "Say Hi" button triggering alert
  - Responsive styling with Vue scoped CSS
- Test coverage: 3 test cases verifying rendering and interaction

## Testing
- Unit tests for Kancolle component (Kancolle.test.jsx)
- Integration tests for API endpoints (not shown in this document)
- All tests pass with `npm test`

## Deployment Notes
- Backend: FastAPI server with Uvicorn
- Frontend: Vite development server with `npm run dev`
- Database: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production

## Future Improvements
- Add analytics integration
- Implement dark mode toggle
- Add user profile management
- Enhance Kancolle component with more interactions
